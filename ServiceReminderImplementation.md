# Fire Extinguisher Service Follow-up Reminder Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds functionality to send follow-up reminder emails 7 days after a fire extinguisher's service has been completed and its expiry date updated. This ensures proper verification of service quality and vendor documentation.

## Components Added

### 1. Database Changes

1. Added `DateServiced` column to the `FireExtinguishers` table to track when a service was completed
2. Created a new `ServiceReminders` table to track service reminders:
   - `ReminderID` - Primary key
   - `FEID` - Fire extinguisher ID
   - `DateServiced` - Date the service was completed
   - `ReminderDate` - Date when the reminder should be sent (7 days after service)
   - `ReminderSent` - Flag to track whether the reminder has been sent
   - `DateCreated` - Timestamp for when the reminder was created

### 2. User Interface Changes

1. Updated the `btnSaveExpiryDate_Click` handler in `ViewSection.aspx.cs` to:
   - Record the service completion date
   - Create a reminder entry in the `ServiceReminders` table
   - Use a transaction to ensure all database changes are atomic
   - Send a service completion email notification

### 3. Notification System Changes

1. Added a service reminder template: `ServiceReminderTemplate.html`
2. Added reminder-related methods to the `ExpiryNotifications` project:
   - `SendServiceReminders` - Main method to check and send reminders
   - `GetPendingServiceReminders` - Retrieves reminders due for today
   - `UpdateReminderStatus` - Marks reminders as sent after email delivery
   - `SendServiceReminderEmail` - Handles the email sending process
   - `GenerateServiceReminderEmail` - Creates HTML email body for a single reminder
   - `GenerateMultipleServiceReminderEmail` - Creates HTML email body for multiple reminders
3. Added `ServiceReminderInfo` class to hold reminder data

### 4. Setup & Deployment

1. Created `DB_Updates.sql` script with the required database changes
2. Created `setup_service_reminders.bat` to execute the SQL script against the database
3. Updated README documentation with instructions on using the new functionality

## Usage Flow

1. **Service Completion:**
   - User completes a fire extinguisher service
   - User enters new expiry date in the system
   - System records service date and creates a reminder

2. **Reminder Processing:**
   - ExpiryNotifications service runs daily
   - Service checks for reminders due within the day
   - Reminders are sent as emails to PIC
   - Reminder records are marked as sent

3. **Follow-up Action:**
   - PIC receives reminder email
   - PIC verifies service quality and documentation
   - If issues found, PIC contacts vendor for corrective action

## Testing

Use the following command to test the service reminder functionality:
```
ExpiryNotifications.exe --test --scenario service
```

This will generate test data and send a sample reminder email without requiring actual database records.
